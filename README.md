# Workshop for Geekfest 2019

We have created a series of exercises to familiarize you with the most common elements of kubernetes. By following the exercises in order you will progressively add more features onto your deployment. The exercises have been setup in a way to guide you so that you can understand how the pieces fit together. 

If you make it through the exercises you can head to the challenges section where you will be tasked to deploy a wordpress instance along with its database, however you will not be provided as much detail on how to do so.
